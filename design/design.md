# Design

A basic design is created using [figma](https://www.figma.com/?fuid=). It includes these components:

> * A header with nav links to different sections of the page:
>   * Home (link to the welcome banner - main page)
>   * About Me (link to the About Me section - current page)
>   * Projects (link to the Projects section - main page)
>   * Skills (link to the Skills section - main page)
>   * Contact (contact page)
> * The section of the pages.
> * The design also includes a bottom banner that generates a random message when the user clicks a button (both on the index and contact pages).
> * A footer with the name of the website, copyright symbol and year. 
> * A page with contact information.
